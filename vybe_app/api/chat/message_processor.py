        - Workspace isolation for file operations
        - Path validation and access control
        - Content moderation and filtering
        - Rate limiting and abuse prevention

Message Validation:
    All messages undergo comprehensive validation including:
    - Required field presence (content, user context)
    - Content length limits and format validation
    - Character encoding and Unicode handling
    - Malicious content detection and prevention
    - Rate limiting based on user and session

Response Formatting:
    Processed messages are formatted for optimal AI model consumption:
    - Standardized JSON structure with metadata
    - Context preservation for conversation continuity
    - Error state handling with descriptive messages
    - Performance metrics and processing timestamps

Example Usage:
    ```python
    # Validate incoming message
    validation_result = validate_message(user_message)
    if not validation_result['valid']:
        return error_response(validation_result['error'])
    
    # Process message for AI
    processed_message = process_message_for_ai(
        message=user_message,
        conversation_history=history,
        user_context=context
    )
    ```

Security Considerations:
    - All user input is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
    - File operations are restricted to designated workspace
    - Rate limiting prevents abuse and resource exhaustion
    - Content filtering blocks inappropriate or harmful content
    - Comprehensive logging for security monitoring

Performance Features:
    - Message caching for frequently accessed content
    - Efficient validation algorithms with minimal overhead
    - Batch processing capabilities for multiple messages
    - Memory-efficient handling of large conversation histories

Dependencies:
    - html: HTML encoding and sanitization
    - typing: Type hints for better code documentation
    - flask: Web framework integration and response formatting
    - logger: Comprehensive logging and error tracking

Note:
    This module is critical for chat security and must be thoroughly tested
    before any modifications. All changes should undergo security review
    to ensure continued protection against malicious input.

# Default system prompt
DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly AI assistant. Provide accurate, clear, and concise responses to help users with their questions and tasks.

You have access to several tools that enhance your capabilities:

🔍 **Web Search**: Search the internet for current information and research
📁 **File Management**: You have a secure workspace directory where you can:
   - List files and directories (ai_list_files_in_directory)
   - Read file contents (ai_read_file) 
   - Write content to files (ai_write_file)
   - Delete files or empty directories (ai_delete_file)

📚 **RAG Knowledge Base**: Query your specialized knowledge collections:
   - Query specific collections: ai_query_rag_collections(query, collection_names=['collection1', 'collection2'])
   - Query all collections: ai_query_rag_collections(query)
   
   Available RAG collections and their contents:
   - Use the ai_query_rag_collections tool to discover and query relevant information
   - You can specify which collections to search based on the user's query context
   - If you're unsure which collections to use, omit the collection_names parameter to search all

⚠️ **Important**: All file operations are restricted to your designated workspace directory for security. You cannot access files outside this workspace.

When working with files, always:
- Use relative paths within your workspace
- Be careful with file operations, especially deletions
- Inform the user about what files you're creating or modifying
- Check if files exist before attempting to read them

When using the RAG system:
- Consider what type of information the user is seeking
- Use specific collection names when you know they're relevant to the query
- The tool will tell you which collections were searched and provide source attribution
- Use RAG queries to supplement your knowledge with domain-specific information

Feel free to use these tools to help users with tasks involving file management, research, knowledge retrieval, or any other assistance they need."""
