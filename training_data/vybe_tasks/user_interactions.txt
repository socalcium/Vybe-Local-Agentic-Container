# Vybe User Interaction Task Specification

## **ðŸŽ¯ Primary Task: Natural Language Understanding & User Experience**

### **Core Responsibility**
The model must excel at understanding user intent, maintaining context, and providing helpful, context-aware responses that optimize the user experience.

### **Key Capabilities Required**

#### **1. Natural Language Understanding**
- **Input**: User queries in natural language
- **Output**: Accurate intent recognition and parameter extraction
- **Examples**:
  - "Can you help me create a chart?" â†’ INTENT: data_visualization, PARAMS: {"chart_type": "auto", "data_source": "user_input"}
  - "I need to analyze some text" â†’ INTENT: text_analysis, PARAMS: {"analysis_type": "general", "text_source": "user_input"}
  - "Generate an image of a sunset" â†’ INTENT: image_generation, PARAMS: {"prompt": "sunset", "style": "realistic"}

#### **2. Context Awareness & Memory**
- **Input**: Conversation history and user preferences
- **Output**: Context-aware responses and personalized suggestions
- **Examples**:
  - "Make it bigger" â†’ Uses context to understand "it" refers to the previously generated image
  - "Try a different style" â†’ Applies to the last generated content with style variation
  - "Save that" â†’ Saves the most recent output based on conversation context

#### **3. Progressive Refinement**
- **Input**: User feedback and iterative requests
- **Output**: Refined outputs based on user preferences
- **Examples**:
  - "Make it more realistic" â†’ Adjusts generation parameters for more realistic output
  - "Use a different color scheme" â†’ Modifies visual elements while maintaining core content
  - "Add more detail" â†’ Enhances output with additional information or complexity

#### **4. User Guidance & Education**
- **Input**: User questions about capabilities or processes
- **Output**: Helpful explanations and guidance
- **Examples**:
  - "What can you do?" â†’ Comprehensive overview of Vybe's capabilities
  - "How do I train a model?" â†’ Step-by-step guidance for model training
  - "What's the best way to organize my data?" â†’ Best practices and recommendations

### **Interaction Patterns**

#### **1. Task-Oriented Interactions**
- **Direct Requests**: "Generate an image of a cat"
- **Parameter Refinement**: "Make it larger and more detailed"
- **Alternative Approaches**: "Try a different approach"
- **Quality Adjustments**: "Make it higher quality"

#### **2. Exploratory Interactions**
- **Capability Discovery**: "What can you do with images?"
- **Feature Exploration**: "Show me different analysis options"
- **Best Practice Learning**: "What's the best way to..."
- **Troubleshooting**: "Why isn't this working?"

#### **3. Workflow Interactions**
- **Multi-step Tasks**: "Download this data, analyze it, and create a report"
- **Iterative Refinement**: Progressive improvement of outputs
- **Context Switching**: Moving between different tasks while maintaining awareness
- **Result Management**: Saving, sharing, and organizing outputs

#### **4. Educational Interactions**
- **Learning Guidance**: "How do I get started with..."
- **Concept Explanation**: "What is fine-tuning?"
- **Best Practice Sharing**: "What's the most efficient way to..."
- **Troubleshooting Help**: "I'm getting this error, what should I do?"

### **Specialized Methods & Techniques**

#### **1. Intent Recognition Patterns**
- **Explicit Intent**: Clear, direct requests
- **Implicit Intent**: Requests that require context understanding
- **Ambiguous Intent**: Requests that need clarification
- **Multi-intent**: Requests with multiple objectives

#### **2. Context Management**
- **Conversation History**: Maintaining awareness of previous interactions
- **User Preferences**: Learning and applying user-specific preferences
- **Task State**: Tracking ongoing tasks and their progress
- **Resource Context**: Understanding available resources and limitations

#### **3. Response Optimization**
- **Clarity**: Clear, understandable responses
- **Conciseness**: Efficient communication without unnecessary detail
- **Helpfulness**: Providing actionable guidance and suggestions
- **Proactivity**: Anticipating user needs and offering relevant suggestions

#### **4. User Experience Enhancement**
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Revealing complexity gradually
- **Error Prevention**: Anticipating and preventing common mistakes
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Streamlining common workflows
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring usability for users of all skill levels

### **Training Data Requirements**
- 5,000+ natural language understanding examples
- 4,000+ context awareness scenarios
